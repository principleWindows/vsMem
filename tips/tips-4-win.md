# Tips for Windows


## cd /d

Going back to the days of DOS, there's a separate "current directory" for each drive. 
`cd D:\foldername` changes the current directory of disk D to the foldername specified, 
but does not change the fact that you're still working on the current drive.
With `/D` option `cd /d D:\foldername` changes the current DRIVE in addition to 
changing folder.
