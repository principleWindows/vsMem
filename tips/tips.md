***************************

## 1 Build from the Command Line

You can build C and C++ applications on the command line by using tools that are included 
in Visual Studio. The Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler toolset is also downloadable as a 
standalone package. You don't need to install the Visual Studio IDE if you don't plan to use it.

> **Note**
>
> This article is about how to set up an environment to use the individual compilers, 
linkers, librarian, and other basic tools. The native project build system, MSBuild, 
does not use the environment as described in this article. For more information on how 
to use MSBuild from the command line, see 
[MSBuild on the command line - C++](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/msbuild-visual-cpp?view=msvc-160).
